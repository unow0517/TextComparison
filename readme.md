### Logic
1. Accept two paragraphs.
2. In both paragraphs, replace multiple spaces with single space(' ').
3. split the paragraphs with space and put them in array respectively.
4. Compare **i** th elements of array, and if doesn't match, the elements shows up in red color.


### Motivation
- I eager to use text comparison software to process [my Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpor_rpeBwgmc1HU0QS0s3A) subtitle, and thought the algorithm wouldn't be extremely complicated. So I made it on my own.
- Want to help lazy people like me.
